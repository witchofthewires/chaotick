# chaotick

A collection of routines for numerical evaluation and graphical representation of systems of differential equations, for use as I work through Strogatz's "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos".

## Description

Right now, the code lives in chaotick.py, and the associated Jupyter workbook shows example use.
